# FastAudioVisual
When doing audio and video sentiment recognition, I found that a lot of code is duplicated, often a function in different time debugging for a long time, based on this problem, I want to manage all the previous work, organized into an open source library can be iterative. For their own use and others. 

This python contains the following features.
1. use a public dataset as a demo. 
2. Add some APIs to quickly convert other datasets to standard data formats.
3. add common audio/video feature extraction APIs. 4. 
4. Add common audio and video feature processing APIs. 5. 
5. add common network model APIs.
6. add APIs or demos for network fusion
7. add the API of visualization effect
8. others.
